How to call paceval.-library functions from NodeJS
--------------------------------------------------

node-ffi-napi is a Node.js addon for loading and calling dynamic libraries (.DLL or .so) using pure 
JavaScript. It can be used to create bindings to native libraries without writing any C++ code.

Potentially you will have to copy the correct library (.DLL or .so) to your file system, 
e.g. "/usr/bin/libpacevalARM64_sharedLIB.so", see below.

2. /Linux/paceval-service_Linux_arm64 - Linux server for ARM64
Annotation: You can easily run the server in the directory with "npm start", see https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/commands/npm-start 
You need node version 18.7.0 or higher, see https://computingforgeeks.com/how-to-install-nodejs-on-ubuntu-debian-linux-mint/
