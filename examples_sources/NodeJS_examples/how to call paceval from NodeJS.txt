How to call paceval.-library functions from NodeJS
--------------------------------------------------

node-ffi-napi is a Node.js addon for loading and calling dynamic libraries (.DLL or .so) using pure 
JavaScript. It can be used to create bindings to native libraries without writing any C++ code.

Potentially you will have to change the php.ini to enable FFI
and to copy the correct library (.DLL or .so) to your file system, 
e.g. "/usr/bin/libpacevalARM64_sharedLIB.so", see below.
